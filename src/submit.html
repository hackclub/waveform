        <!-- <div class="gap"></div> -->

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">submitting to waveform? first make sure you've met these requirements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>make sure you're using <a href="https://hackatime.hackclub.com">hackatime</a></li>
            <li>it <i>HAS</i> to use webaudio - I know there are audio reactive libraries out there, but I want you to learn
                webaudio and figure out how to piece 1 to 1</li>
            <li>you can build anything audio-reactive - if you're building a rhythm platformer that has audio-reactive
                elements, that counts! (still needs to use webaudio though)</li>
            <li>anything <i>experimental</i> - what matters is figuring out what you want and what works for you. it doesn't
                have to be extremely polished and high quality, but it should be obvious that you've spent time
                experimenting and trying to build something that you're proud of. I do not want AI slop or submissions
                that look exactly like my example.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>also...no double dipping with SOM :p</p>
